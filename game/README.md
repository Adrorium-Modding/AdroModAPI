# Game Files

This ONLY contains a changelog and assemblies.
The assemblies in the `assemblies` folder are publicized and stripped.

The `raw_assemblies` folder contains the unstripped and unpublicized assemblies,
and as such should NEVER be committed to git.

> game devs please dont destroy me i stripped your assemblies :3 \
> i need these for CI \
> if they aren't stripped because of some error please contact me \
> ill try to purge the git history of them if that happens
